# Latency can be reduced at the expense of network efficiency and
# system CPU time by adjusting implicit batching parameters.  The
# default parameters hold messages for up to 200 milliseconds or until
# 2048 bytes are waiting to go.  The lowest possible latency is
# obtained by setting the minimum batching length to 1 byte, which
# effectively disables the implicit batching feature.  For example:
#
context mim_implicit_batching_minimum_length 1
source      implicit_batching_minimum_length 1

# For Multicast immediate messages
#context mim_implicit_batching_minimum_length 2048
