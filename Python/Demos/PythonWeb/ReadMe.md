See Web section

Web apps are often created using a framework. Frameworks make it easier to develop web apps that are scalable, reliable and maintainable. It avoids recreating the same code over and over again.
Common features are:

URL Routing
Output templates
Database management
Session management
Security against common attacks
A framework may offer some or all of these features.

For example, the Flask web application framework does not have database support and you would need a separate module to use a database.  The Django web application framework supports databases by default.

The most popular python web application framework is Django, followed by Flask.
